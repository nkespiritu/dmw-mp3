What characterizes superhost listings? What are the types of superhost listings, such that a traveler can discern where they should stay? For these superhosts, what can they do to stand amongst other superhosts?

To answer this, the Airbnb listings dataset of Tokyo, Kant≈ç, Japan was used. A pre-COVID scenario was considered; thus, the December 30, 2019 crawl date was used. The dataset was then trimmed down by only taking the listings posted by superhosts. From here, the researchers conducted clustering on the resulting superhosts dataset and searched for common characteristics between the listings through an exploratory data analysis on each cluster found.

By conducting principal component analysis and k-medians clustering, the researchers were able to come up with 3 distinct clusters, fit for 3 customer types: high-paying guests, families, and budget travelers. Distinct features of each cluster were identified through exploratory data analysis on variables related to property type, price, ratings, and amenities. High-paying guests are faced with cost-inefficient Airbnb listings. Families are presented with listings that are more spacious and have more family-friendly amenities. Finally, budget travelers can choose from budget-friendly options, all rich with amenities similar to listings fit for families.
